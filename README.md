# HwidCollection

Using WMI this project in c# collects hardware information on users which can be stored in a database to hwid lock content. This project requires the system.windows.forms and system.management references which can be found in your .net library folder or in the build of the application. This program uses  Prcoessor ID, UUID, MAC Address, Disk Serials Motherboard Name and Monitor Information to allow you to securely lock your software to user's computers in a c# application, this doesn't include a backend or http server of any kind but this is just hardware collection to be implemented into your own sources. I would advise you add a WMI process check and dont give it to a user on windows 7, windows 7 doesn't have too much support for WMI.  Dont store the information in a byte array, store it in a database logging all the information in separate cells in the database or people can just change 1 piece of the hwid collected and set off the program or mess up the hwid checks.  I advise to use processor ID, Motherboard Name and Monitor Size as ways for you to manually check if someone is changing their hwid since they aren't unique identifiers. The Hwid Spoofer checker isn't the best but should be used to notify you if someone is using a pathetically bad hwid spoofer which changes all the serials to the same serial but it is probably easily flawed.
